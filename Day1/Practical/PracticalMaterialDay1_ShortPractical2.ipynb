    "Good. You've seen in **Exercise 1** and in the lectures that the features should be normalised to make gradient descent work well. High time to write a function to normalise these features. Call it `createNormalisedFeatures`. The function should have an argument `mode` that accepts two inputs, 'SD' and 'range'. For 'SD', the normalisation should return:\n",
    "* the mean of each feature.\n",
    "* the standard deviation of each feature.\n",
    "* the normalised feature itself, using the formula: <br> $$\\frac{(feature\\ values - feature\\ mean)}{feature\\ standard\\  deviation}$$ <br>\n",

    "##### Why do we need the means and std. dev./range saved?\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Why these different normalisations? <br>\n",
    "The SD normalisation brings features to *approximately* the \\[-1,1\\] range, however outliers still go slightly above or below this: we normalise based on the standard deviation or average difference of the data from the mean, so points that are far from this mean will have larger values. In other words: this assumes a normal distribution of data, and shrinks that distribution to have mean 0 and *most* of its observations in the \\[-1,1\\] range. <br>\n",
    "The range normalisation brings everything to a \\[-1,1\\] range outright, no exceptions. Do note that if you have huge outliers, most data will be compressed to a tiny range, with the outliers being close to 1 or -1. <br>\n",

    "<b> Hints </b> \n",
    "* To return multiple values in one function, simply put them in a list: `return [thing1,thing2,ChickenLittle]`. In this case, order the return values like so: `[normalisedFeatures, featureMeans, featureSD/featureRanges]` <br>\n",
    "* You can simply use `someDataFrame.mean()` and `someDataFrame.std()` to get means and standard deviations for each column, respectively. Range can be found in a similar way, using `someDataFrameRange = someDataFrame.max() - someDataFrame.min()`.
