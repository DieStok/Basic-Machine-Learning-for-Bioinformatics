# Content of this folder

This folder contains the slides of a course called Crash Course Deep Learning, taught at UU in 2019 by [Prof. Dr. Alexander Sch√∂nhuth](https://gds.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/). 
He works on applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (such as [capsule networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsbTwuE9R2A)) to biological problems.
He kindly agreed for me to share this slide deck with you. If you want full mathematical derivations of certain techniques, or more insight
on things such as dropout and the vanishing gradient problem, these slides are for you. They also go into much further detail on convolutional
neural networks.

These slides are specifically **extra material** and are **not required content** for this course. They can serve as useful founts of knowledge
for when you are plunging the depths of deep learning later and want to look at some central repository that has a lot of the information you'll need.
