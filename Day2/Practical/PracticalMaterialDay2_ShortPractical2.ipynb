    "## Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation is a method of automatically constraining how much your model can (over)fit on the training data. We add some factor (regularisation weight $\\lambda$) times the sum of squares of the parameter (excluding the intercept ($\\theta_0$) to the cost function. In this way, the model cannot pick extremely large values for the parameters, i.e. when you have 100 features, the model is forced to only have high $\\theta$ parameters for those features that matter a lot for correct classification, while having extremely low or even 0 values for features that don't. Hence, regularisation also automatically selects features that are of importance to your problem: feature selection! Note that once you have trained the model and want to know the cost on the validation/test set, you should not used regularised cost: you care about your performance in the end (which you hope is better because you constrain the parameters during fitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "* To get started, change your costFuncLogReg to have an extra argument `lambda_ = 0` ( _ because lambda is a keword for anonymous functions), that, if set to a value higher than 0, causes regularisation to be performed.\n",
    "* Make sure to exclude the bias/intercept term ($\\theta_0$) from this. By convention this is not regularised.\n",

We will discuss K-Nearest Neighbour clustering in two days. For now, you can just use it.

In other words: unregularised logistic regression would have overfit, tuning the parameters _too specifically_ to the values in the training set, which increases the cost on the unseen test set. Regularisation guards against this by penalising too large parameters. Note that if you change the seed, sometimes you actually get lower cost values without regularisation: in that case there was apparently a lucky split of the data such that overfitting was very difficult anyway. However, you don't want to be dependent on lucky splits, so you can use regularisation to make sure that there's no overfitting to the training data.\n",

    "## Conclusion visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main thing to note is, of course, that such a dimension-reduced visualisation is imperfect. You do clearly see that as the lambda values increase, so too does the size of the banded regions become more uniform: the classifier has learned less because with lambdas of 100 and 1000 we are hugely penalising it for any fit to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classifier perfomance\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked in the lectures about the performance of a classification algorithm. We want to know the true positive rate and false positive rates for a given threshold, but also the classifier's performance over a range of thresholds. It is not too difficult to make a ROC curve yourself. Let's do that now for the best classifier (with the lowest mean cost on the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to you to:\n",
    "* Make a range of 200 thresholds (from 1 to 0) for saying something is the positive set (use `np.linspace` for this).\n",
    "* Make two empty lists: `truePositiveRates` and `trueNegativeRates`.\n",
    "* Make predictions on the `testDataDiabetes` using the best set of learned thetas (which you can manually select).\n",
    "* Make a for loop over the different thresholds you defined. Within that loop:\n",
    "    * Turn the predictions into class labels using `np.where` and the current threshold value.\n",
    "    * Calculate the true positive rate (sensitivity/recall) and append it to the list.\n",
    "    * Calculate the true negative rate and append it to the list.\n",
    "* Finally make a plot of the sensitivity (true positive rate) on the y-axis and 1-specificity (1-TNR) on the x-axis. (use `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` and `ax.plot()`). Don't forget to set the axis labels and a title!\n",
    "\n",
