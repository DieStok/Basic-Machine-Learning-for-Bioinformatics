    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is one way to get the minimum of a function, but it is certainly not the only one. You might have noticed that we ran it for a thousand iterations above and it moved slowly. This is because the gradients become very small when the predictions are almost correct (if your hypothesis predicts 0.00 but it should be 0 exactly, you can see how that would lead to exceedingly small steps to correct this). Therefore, we might wish to turn to other optimisation methods. There are many other ones that incorporate all sorts of smart tricks. Those of you who've followed the BiBC Essentials Course should remember some of them! Here, you're going to optimise logistic regression not using simple gradient descent, but one of the more involved optimisers. We won't go into how they work (that's a numerical mathematics course in its own right), just know that they are faster and will require inputs in a slightly different form. You need to:\n",

    "* To do that:\n",
    "    1. Make a copy of the gradient descent function, with the following arguments: `linAlgGradient(thetas, x, y, hypothesis = 'linAlgLogRegHypothesis')`. The reordering of the arguments is because fmin_bfgs wants the first argument of each function to be its parameters (thetas). This copy should not return the new thetas (as in our normal gradient descent function) but just the array of gradients (partial derivatives) of the cost function. Hence this function doesn't need an alpha parameter. Make sure to wrap the returned values in `np.ravel()` so they are in the dimension fmin_bfgs wants.\n",
    "    2. The function to optimise is the cost function. Make a copy of it that has the thetas as its first arguments `costFuncLogReg2(thetas, x, y)`.\n",

Note that the warnings are because certain values, when exponentiated, become np.nan (too large or too small to hold in a floating point value) and because log(0) is -Inf.

    "Congratulations, you've implemented logistic regression, both using gradient descent and using a more advanced optimisation algorithm. You might feel that you don't know what the heck BFGS is doing, and that's fine: the modern ML libraries you'll use when applying your knowledge to (biological) problems use appropriate optimisation methods behind the scenes, or if you need to select them manually you can simply test and see which works best. The thing you should remember is that if gradients get small, gradient descent can progress extremely slowly. \n",
