    "# **Introductory Jupyter notebook**\n",
    "Hi there! Welcome to this short introductory Jupyter notebook. The purpose of this notebook is to quickly introduce the way the practicals in the course will work, while also introducing you to some Numpy features. In this course, I often ask you to write functions that take specific inputs and produce specific outputs. Some of you may be used to this functional programming, while others are more familiar with scripting or coding as you go. The Introduction to Python course doesn't spend a huge amount of time on making functions (as far as I know), so this refresher might be useful. In the previous edition of the course some students thought learning ML stuff _and_ adapting to this functional style was a bit much, so this introductory notebook is to aid you **_if you need it_**. \n",

    "What you should see is that flatten makes a set of numbers into a 1D array, with dimensions (n_numbers, ). However, if we want a table, i.e. a 2D array, we can make it by adding another axis to the data. Then, for instance, the 9-number array has dimension  (1,9), for 1 row, nine numbers. Now, you could append another row below by using `np.concatenate((my_awesome_data.flatten()[np.newaxis, :], my_awesome_data.flatten()[np.newaxis, :]))`. You don't have to do too much with this information, except that you know that Numpy uses axes to determine what 'shape' numbers are in, and we might sometimes want to change the shape. Things can break down if numbers are not both in 2D arrays when you want to combine them into a bigger table, and then you need to know what might be going on, namely: mismatched shapes."

Shape is a tuple with 2 values (e.g. `(5, 6)`), method can be either `'zeroes'`, `'ones'`, or `'normal'`. The function should return a matrix/table of dimension shape filled with either all 0s, all 1s, or values drawn from a standard normal distribution, depending on the method argument. If the method argument is something other than the three possibilities, the function should say so and return nothing (specifically: `None`). If the method argument is not given, it should default to the normally distributed values.\n",

For instance, you could define `shape = (3,4)` and `method = 'normal'`, and then write the desired behaviour using an if-statement for method and the correct Numpy function. Then you can expand this, and finally put everything into a function. As an illustration for zeroes below:"

In principle practical exercises during the course should be explained in more detail, so just try this and see how you get on. If you don't manage or need to spend a long time: just skip it! You already have some idea of what Numpy can do and that's fine as a basis. Remember to use search engines to your advantage during the course (:\n",

    "Write a function `getMaxMinCoords` that returns the coordinates of the maximum and minimum element in a `numpy.ndarray` with 2 or more dimensions as a tuple of tuples. That is, if it is a 2D array, you will get something like `((coord1_max, coord2_max), (coord1_min, coord2_min))`. Here `coord1_max` would be like the row-index of the maximal number in the 2D array, and `coord2_max` the column-index. If there's no unique maximum or minimum element, _the function should fail, return `None`, and tell you so_. Be sure to search through the documentation of Numpy and Stackoverflow for this one!\n",

    "This was a very basic (can you feel those hydroxide ions deep inside?) introduction to the type of practicals you'll be doing during the course: using Numpy and writing functions yourself. Of course, we will be applying that to ML problems instead of random Numpy functionality. To get a bit of an overview of ML before we get started, I highly recommend scanning [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-021-00407-0). If that doesn't work, try [this](https://rdcu.be/c6jAm). If that doesn't work you have been blessed by whatever deity you'd prefer and can skip this completely. You can skip this completely anyway since it's an optional thing to read before the course starts, but that'll be our secret. "
