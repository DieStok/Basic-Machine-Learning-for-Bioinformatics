    "# **Introductory Jupyter notebook**\n",
    "Hi there! Welcome to this short introductory Jupyter notebook. The purpose of this notebook is to quickly introduce the way the practicals in the course will work, while also introducing you to some Numpy features. In this course, I often ask you to write functions that take specific inputs and produce specific outputs. Some of you may be used to this functional programming, while others are more familiar with scripting or coding as you go. The Introduction to Python course doesn't spend a huge amount of time on making functions (as far as I know), so this refresher might be useful. In the previous edition of the course some students thought learning ML stuff _and_ adapting to this functional style was a bit much, so this introductory notebook is to aid you **_if you need it_**. \n",

    "What you should see is that flatten makes a set of numbers into a 1D array, with dimensions (n_numbers, ). However, if we want a table, i.e. a 2D array, we can make it by adding another axis to the data. Then, for instance, the 9-number array has dimension  (1,9), for 1 row, nine numbers. Now, you could append another row below by using `np.concatenate((my_awesome_data.flatten()[np.newaxis, :], my_awesome_data.flatten()[np.newaxis, :]))`. You don't have to do too much with this information, except that you know that Numpy uses axes to determine what 'shape' numbers are in, and we might sometimes want to change the shape. Things can break down if numbers are not both in 2D arrays when you want to combine them into a bigger table, and then you need to know what might be going on, namely: mismatched shapes."

Shape is a tuple with 2 values (e.g. `(5, 6)`), method can be either `'zeroes'`, `'ones'`, or `'normal'`. The function should return a matrix/table of dimension shape filled with either all 0s, all 1s, or values drawn from a standard normal distribution, depending on the method argument. If the method argument is something other than the three possibilities, the function should say so and return nothing (specifically: `None`). If the method argument is not given, it should default to the normally distributed values.\n",
