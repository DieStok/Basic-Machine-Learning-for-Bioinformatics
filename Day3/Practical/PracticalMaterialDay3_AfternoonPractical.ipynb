    "## Backpropagation recap\n",
    "#### Feel free to skip if you've heard enough about it already!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to step back and understand what you want to do here. We want to change the parameters of the network such that we can decrease the cost on our training examples. This involves calculating partial derivatives of the cost with respect to all the parameters in the network. The _way_ we do that is by chaining many partial derivatives together: the chain rule of derivation will be getting some heavy use. To recap what you've learned so far: the fundamental equations of backpropagation are:\n",
    "1. **The error of a neuron**:\n",
    "$$\\delta^{(l)}_j = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}$$\n",
    "This says: the error of a certain neuron _j_ in layer _l_ is equal to the partial derivative of the cost with respect to the weighted sum it produces (remember, $z^{(l)}_j$ is just $\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_i \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b$. In other words: in our case a neuron in the output network takes in 25 inputs ($a^{(l-1)}_1$ until $a^{(l-1)}_{25}$) and multiplies them with a separate weight for each, takes the sum, and adds the bias). And that $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}$ in turn is equal to the partial derivative of the cost with respect to the activation, times the partial derivative of the activation with respect to this weighted sum. This is because of the chain rule: ![ChainRule](ChainRule.PNG) We want the derivative of the cost relative to the weighted sum (because we can change those weights and the bias), but those are passed through the nonlinear sigmoid activation function. So in our case, $ f = \\sigma(g)$ and $g(inputs, weights, biases) = \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{i,j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j = z^{(l)}_j$. Luckily the derivative of the sigmoid function is easy: $\\sigma(x) \\cdot \\sigma(1-x)$. Note also that our function g depends on the inputs of the previous layer, the weights, and the bias, so we need partial derivatives with respect to each of these! <br> <br> If we fill that all in we get:\n",
    "$$ \\delta^{(l)}_j = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial {sigmoid(\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{i,j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j})} \\cdot \\frac{{\\partial {sigmoid(\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{i,j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j})}}{{\\partial \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{i,j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j}}$$ Which equals:\n",
    "$$ \\delta^{(l)}_j = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial {sigmoid(\\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{i,j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j})} \\cdot {sigmoid(z^{(l)}_j) \\cdot (1 - sigmoid(z^{(l)}_j))}$$\n",
    "You can just think of delta as the partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. the weighted sum that a certain neuron produces. To be entirely sure that this is understood, look at the image below: ![image](ExampleNeuralNetwork5.PNG) The cost function in this case hinges on $$\\begin{bmatrix}a^{(l)}_1 = 0.33 \\\\ a^{(l)}_2 = 0.8 \\\\ a^{(l)}_3 = 0.189\\end{bmatrix}$$ So we have here $$\\begin{bmatrix}\\delta^{(l)}_1 = \\sigma'(0 -  0.330) = \\sigma'(-0.33) \\\\ \\delta^{(l)}_2 = \\sigma'(1 - 0.800) = \\sigma'(0.2) \\\\ \\delta^{(l)}_3 = \\sigma'(0 - 0.189) = \\sigma'(-0.189)\\end{bmatrix}$$ We can calculate those values, and they turn out to be  $$\\begin{bmatrix}\\delta^{(l)}_1 \\approx 0.24 \\\\ \\delta^{(l)}_2 \\approx 0.25 \\\\ \\delta^{(l)}_3 \\approx 0.25\\end{bmatrix}$$ If those values seem awfully similar to you, remember that between -1 and 1 the sigmoid curve pretty much [looks like a straight line](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/15157249643325#!) and hence it makes sense that its gradient there is pretty much one value. <br> **Now it turns out that for the derivative of cross entropy (the cost function we're using instead of MSE), $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}$ just simplifies to $\\delta^{(l)}_j$ because it cancels out the sigmoid derivative. See the derivative of cross entropy [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/371282) and look at the Deep Learning Crash Course slides in the extra material if you want to learn more!**\n",
    "Okay, so we now have a partial derivative for the cost w.r.t. the neurons in the output layer. With that we can move on to part 2 and 3. <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. a bias**. This is just:  $$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial b^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial b^{(l)}_j} = \\delta^{(l)}_j \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial b^{(l)}_j}$$ Or in words: how the cost is affected by a certain bias is how the cost is changed by a certain activation times how that activation is changed by a weighted sum times how that weighted sum is changed by a change in its bias. It is easy to see that $$\\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial b^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_i \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j}{\\partial {b^{(l)}_j}} = 1 $$This is just like $$\\frac{\\partial (ax + b)}{\\partial {b}} = 1 $$ while $$\\frac{\\partial (ax + b)}{\\partial {a}} = x $$Taken together, the partial derivative of the cost relative to a certain bias is just $$\\delta^{(l)}_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. a weight**. This is just: $$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial w^{(l)}_{i,j}} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial w^{(l)}_{i,j}} = \\delta^{(l)}_j \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial w^{(l)}_{i,j}}$$ For our toy network above, i runs from 1 to 2: there are 2 inputs for each neuron in the output layer, 1 for each hidden unit, and they both have a weight. j runs from 1 to 3 for the 3 neurons in the output layer. If we expand the term on the right and calculate it, we get: $$\\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial w^{(l)}_{i,j}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sum \\limits _{i=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{i,j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i  + b^{(l)}_j}{\\partial {w^{(l)}_{i,j}}} =  a^{(l-1)}_i$$ Putting it together, we get: $$\\delta^{(l)}_j \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_i$$ <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Computing the partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. the activations from the previous layer --> propagating the errors back one layer**. We've done the partial derivatives of the weights and the biases, but we also want to calculate the partial derivative of the cost function relative to the input activations the output layer got. Here goes: \n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial z^{(l-1)}_{j}} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial a^{(l-1)}_{j}} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l-1)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l-1)}_{j}} = \\delta^{(l)}_j \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial a^{(l-1)}_{j}} \\cdot \\sigma'(z^{(l-1)}_j)$$\n",
    "In words: How the partial derivative of the cost hinges on the weighted sum $z^{(l-1)}_{j}$ in the previous layer is how the cost hinges on the activations in the output layer, times how the activations in the output layer hinge on the weighted sum that the output layer calculates, times how that weighted sum hinges on the activations it takes in from layer l-1, times how those activations hinge on their weighted sum. We already know $$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(l)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(l)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} = \\delta^{(l)}_j \\\\ \\mbox{and} \\frac{\\partial a^{(l-1)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l-1)}_{j}} \\mbox{is just the sigmoid derivative: } \\sigma(z^{(l-1)}_j) \\cdot (1-\\sigma(z^{(l-1)}_j))$$ So all we need to do is calculate: $$\\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial a^{(l-1)}_{j}}$$ which is just:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial z^{(l)}_j}{\\partial a^{(l-1)}_{j}} = \\frac{\\partial \\sum \\limits _{j=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{j} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_j  + b^{(l)}_j}{\\partial {a^{(l-1)}_{j}}} =  \\sum \\limits _{j=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{j}$$. Finally this results in: $$\\delta^{(l-1)}_j = \\sum \\limits _{j=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{j} \\cdot \\delta^{(l)}_j \\cdot \\sigma'(z^{(l-1)}_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phew, that's a lot. The executive summary:\n",
    "1. Calculate error in the final layer with $\\delta_j^{(L)} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(L)}_j} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial a^{(L)}_j}{\\partial z^{(l)}_j} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial a^{(L)}_j} \\cdot \\sigma'(z^{(L)}_j)$. **For the cross entropy cost function that we use, this is just $a^{(L)}_j - y_j$**\n",
    "2. The partial derivative w.r.t. to each bias is just $\\delta_j^{(l)}$.\n",
    "3. The partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. each weight is just $\\delta_j^{(l)} \\cdot a^{(l-1)}_j$\n",
    "4. You can propagate the initial error back by multiplying it with the weights and multiplying with the derivative of the sigmoid function to get $\\delta^{(l-1)}_j = \\sum \\limits _{j=1} ^{n_{weights}} w_{j} \\cdot \\delta^{(l)}_j \\sigma'(z^{(l-1)}_j)$"

Thinking in linear algebra, we thus need to multiply them with a column or row of ones in some matrix. For the weights, it's each element of $\\delta^{(L)}$ multiplied with the activations of the previous layer that led to it $A^{(l)}$. Note that I've added indices like $s_1$ to indicate sample 1 or sample 2. So we get: $$ {\\delta^{(L)}}^T \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a^{(l)}_1s_1 & a^{(l)}_2s_1 \\\\ 1 & a^{(l)}_1s_2 & a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.8 \\\\ 0.4 & -0.3 \\\\ 0.03 & 0.54 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & a^{(l)}_1s_1 & a^{(l)}_2s_1 \\\\ 1 & a^{(l)}_1s_2 & a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\cdot 1 + 0.8 \\cdot 1 & 0.6 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1  + 0.8 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2  & 0.6 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + 0.8 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2  \\\\ 0.4 \\cdot 1 + -0.3 \\cdot 1 & 0.4 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1 + -0.3 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2 & 0.4 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + -0.3 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\\\ 0.03 \\cdot 1 + 0.54 \\cdot 1 & 0.03 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1 + 0.54 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2 & 0.03 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + 0.54 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\end{bmatrix}$$ What you see is that this is a matrix which has in its rows the sums of the gradient for each neuron. Thus, in the first row, the first column just has the summed $\\delta^{(L)}$-values for that neuron: exactly the partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. the bias of neuron 1 in the output layer, summed over the training examples! The second column has the partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. the first weight of neuron 1 in the output layer, summed over the training examples. Finally, the third column has the partial derivative of the cost w.r.t. the second weight of neuron 1 in the output layer, summed over the training examples. The second and third row have this for the other two neurons in the output layer. To go from this sum to the gradient, all we have to do is multiply with $\\frac{1}{m}$, which in this case is $\\frac{1}{2}$: $$\\Delta^{(L)} = \\frac{1}{m}\\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\cdot 1 + 0.8 \\cdot 1 & 0.6 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1  + 0.8 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2  & 0.6 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + 0.8 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2  \\\\ 0.4 \\cdot 1 + -0.3 \\cdot 1 & 0.4 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1 + -0.3 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2 & 0.4 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + -0.3 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\\\ 0.03 \\cdot 1 + 0.54 \\cdot 1 & 0.03 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1 + 0.54 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2 & 0.03 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + 0.54 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\end{bmatrix}$$ This'll average the gradients over all training examples, giving you the gradient w.r.t. the bias and cost for each neuron in the output layer! <br> . Note that this matrix is exactly in the shape of $\\Theta^{(2)}$, which looks like: $$\\begin{bmatrix} b^{(L)}_1 & w_1n_1^{(L)} & w_2n_1^{(L)} \\\\ b^{(L)}_2  & w_1n_2^{(L)} & w_2n_2^{(L)}  \\\\ b^{(L)}_3  & w_1n_3^{(L)} & w_2n_3^{(L)}\\end{bmatrix}$$ So if you'd want to take a gradient step, you could just do $$\\Theta^{(2)}_{new} = \\Theta^{(2)} - \\frac{\\alpha}{m} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\cdot 1 + 0.8 \\cdot 1 & 0.6 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1  + 0.8 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2  & 0.6 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + 0.8 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2  \\\\ 0.4 \\cdot 1 + -0.3 \\cdot 1 & 0.4 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1 + -0.3 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2 & 0.4 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + -0.3 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\\\ 0.03 \\cdot 1 + 0.54 \\cdot 1 & 0.03 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_1 + 0.54 \\cdot a^{(l)}_1s_2 & 0.03 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_1 + 0.54 \\cdot a^{(l)}_2s_2 \\end{bmatrix} $$ <br> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Partial derivatives w.r.t. weighted sums in the previous layer ($Z^{(l)}$), i.e. propagating back the error**: Remember, the steps we need to take are: multiplying $\\delta^{(L)}$ with the weights (which are in $\\Theta^{(2)}$) and then multiplying with the derivative of the sigmoid on the weighted sums that the Hidden Layer produces ($\\sigma(Z^{(l)})$. To do that first multiply the two together: $$\\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.4 & 0.03 \\\\ 0.8  & -0.3 & 0.54 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} b^{(L)}_1 & w_1n_1^{(L)} & w_2n_1^{(L)} \\\\ b^{(L)}_2  & w_1n_2^{(L)} & w_2n_2^{(L)}  \\\\ b^{(L)}_3  & w_1n_3^{(L)} & w_2n_3^{(L)}\\end{bmatrix}$$ You'll see that there's something wrong here: there's biases, but the partial derivative only includes the weight, not them. So only include the 2nd to last column of $\\Theta^{(2)}$ instead: $$\\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.4 & 0.03 \\\\ 0.8  & -0.3 & 0.54 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}  w_1n_1^{(L)} & w_2n_1^{(L)} \\\\ w_1n_2^{(L)} & w_2n_2^{(L)}  \\\\ w_1n_3^{(L)} & w_2n_3^{(L)}\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 \\cdot w_1n_1^{(L)} + 0.4 \\cdot w_1n_2^{(L)} + 0.03 \\cdot w_1n_3^{(L)} & 0.6 \\cdot w_2n_1^{(L)} + 0.4 \\cdot w_2n_2^{(L)} + 0.03 \\cdot w_2n_3^{(L)} \\\\ 0.8 \\cdot w_1n_1^{(L)} + -0.3 \\cdot w_1n_2^{(L)} + 0.54 \\cdot w_1n_3^{(L)} & 0.8 \\cdot w_2n_1^{(L)} + -0.3 \\cdot w_2n_2^{(L)} + 0.54 \\cdot w_2n_3^{(L)} \\end{bmatrix}$$ This gives us a matrix very similar to $\\delta^{(L)}$. Only now there's just 2 columns for the 2 neurons in the HL! The final thing that's left to do is to multiply each of these values with the corresponding sigmoid derivative: $$\\sigma'(Z^{(l)}) = \\sigma'(\\begin{bmatrix}  1 \\cdot b_1 + f_{1}v_{1} \\cdot w_1n_1 + f_2v_1 \\cdot w_2n_1 & 1 \\cdot b_1 + f_1v_2 \\cdot w_1n_1 + f_2v_2 \\cdot w_2n_1 \\\\  1 \\cdot b_2 + f_1v_1 \\cdot w_1n_2 + f_2v_1 \\cdot w_2n_2 &  1 \\cdot b_2 + f_1v_2 \\cdot w_1n_2 + f_2v_2 \\cdot w_2n_2 \\end{bmatrix})$$ Note that you already calculate $Z^{(l)}$ in the forward pass. In total, it looks like: $$\\begin{bmatrix} 0.6 & 0.4 & 0.03 \\\\ 0.8  & -0.3 & 0.54 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix}  w_1n_1^{(L)} & w_2n_1^{(L)} \\\\ w_1n_2^{(L)} & w_2n_2^{(L)}  \\\\ w_1n_3^{(L)} & w_2n_3^{(L)}\\end{bmatrix} \\odot \\begin{bmatrix}  \\sigma'(1 \\cdot b_1 + f_{1}v_{1} \\cdot w_1n_1 + f_2v_1 \\cdot w_2n_1) & \\sigma'(1 \\cdot b_1 + f_1v_2 \\cdot w_1n_1 + f_2v_2 \\cdot w_2n_1) \\\\  \\sigma'(1 \\cdot b_2 + f_1v_1 \\cdot w_1n_2 + f_2v_1 \\cdot w_2n_2) &  \\sigma'(1 \\cdot b_2 + f_1v_2 \\cdot w_1n_2 + f_2v_2 \\cdot w_2n_2) \\end{bmatrix}$$ This'll give you $\\delta^{(l)}$, which looks like: <br> $$\\begin{bmatrix} \\delta_1^{(l)} & \\delta_2^{(l)} \\\\ \\delta_1^{(l)} & \\delta_2^{(l)} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",

    "An accuracy of 93% on the test set using a dense neural network is nothing to scoff at, but you know that convolutional neural networks (along with other innovations like Dropout and other activation functions) are what made the real leaps in performance possible. Using the Keras library, you can easily train your own convolutional neural network. \n",

    "* As you step through it be sure to search for things you don't know about and think about the dimensionality. What is the total dimensionality of the data after you've run 32 convolutional filters over it? `model.summary()` shows this, but see if you get it.\n",
    "* As an **optional** question: you could try to get the untrained and trained filter weights and visualise them to see what sort of features in the image each filter has become attuned to.
