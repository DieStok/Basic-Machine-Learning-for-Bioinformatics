    "Hi there. It could well be that your head is still reeling from the explanation of backpropagation. While it's a simple idea at its core, it can not seem that way at first. It helps to learn about it from different angles. For that reason, this practical will be devoid of any programming. Rather, you'll be watching 2 videos and reading about backpropagation. \n",
